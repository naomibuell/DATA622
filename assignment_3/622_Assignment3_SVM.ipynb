    "As background for this assignment, we reviewed the Ahmad et al. (2021) and Guhathakurata1 et al. (2021) articles on predicting COVID-19 cases using ML (ML) algorithms. These studies use different data sources and features to make these predictions: Ahmad uses COVID polymerase chain reaction lab test data from a hospital in Brazil, while Guhathakurata created a dataset of individuals' COVID symptoms and comorbidities to predict cases. The Ahmad (2021) article uses a single decision tree, random forest, bagging, XGBoost, AdaBoost, balanced random forest (RUS), and combinations of bagging, SMOTE oversampling, and RUS with these algorithms. Notably, SVMs were not tested in this article. The Guhathakuratal (2021) article uses the supervised ML Algorithms K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Binary Tree, and SVM. The Ahmad (2021) compares algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure, AUROC, and AUPRC. The Guhathakuratal (2021) uses fewer metrics for comparison--just precision, recall, f1-score, and support. The Guthathakuratal (2021) article finds that SVMs outperform the other algorithms tested, while the Ahmad (2021) article finds that decision tree ensembles developed for imbalanced datasets perform best. We will borrow the use of precision, recall, and F1 from both articles to compare the SVM results with the decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost results from Homework #2.\n",

    "We found the following 3 articles that compare the use of decision trees and SVM in our current areas of expertise: public health and data science.\n",

    "1. [Machine Learning Techniques in Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Comparative Study of Classification Model Performance (Phuong, 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735336/). As a public health researcher, Naomi has worked on a simulation model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in a population. Similarly, this article works in the same field--predicting CKD--but does so using several ML techniques: random forest, SVM, naive bayes, logistic regression, KNN, and XGBoost. The data in this study comes from the UC Irvine ML Repository, while the model Naomi worked on uses population data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). Similar to Naomi's work, the model predicts CKD based on potassium levels, urea, blood pressure, and other features related to kidney function. This article finds that Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and logistic regression performed best (with an accuracy of 100%!), followed by Naive Bayes (97%) and KNN (93%).\n",

    "2. [Machine learning prediction of dropping out of outpatients with alcohol use disorders (Park, 2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255626). This study developed a ML algorithm to predict the risk of patients dropping out of outpatient treatment schemes for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Naomi has experience working with substance use disorder and mental health data in her role as a public health researcher, so this study was relevant to her expertise. Data was obtained for this study on patients with AUD from three hospitals within a medical center in South Korea, measuring whether patients continued to follow up or if they dropped out of treatment. The researchers implemented six ML models—logistic regression, SVM, kNN, random forest, neural network, and AdaBoost. They compared AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across all models, and the AdaBoost model was determined to be the best.\n",

We also drop `pdays` (number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign) since it is 96% missing and was determined to be not useful for prediction according to the IV. For the other columns with minor missingness (`education`, `housing`, `loan`, `job`, and `marital`), we will drop rows with missing data. Since the missingness is low, we will not lose much information by dropping these rows. We also drop the `duration` column, the last contact duration in seconds, because this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=\"no\"). Per the bank data notes, this input should be discarded for our predictive model."

This really low score means that the model is failing to identify about 83% of actual customers with subscriptions--much lower than the final SVM model (70.48%). Despite this, the model showed high precision (70%) meaning that there's a strong chance that any customer predicted to subscribe actually does so. The high accuracy of 90% is misleading due to the imbalanced dataset, even though it is better than the SVM model (72.01%)."

    "From our grid search, our optimal AdaBoost model has a learning rate of 0.85 and 20 estimators. This method seems to be highly effective as we have a high recall indicating that we are able to correctly identify 69.77% of actual subscribers in the test set, only slightly worse than the final SVM at 70.48%. However, the precision is quite low at 25% meaning that many of our predictions are false positives--slightly more false positives than the 24% in the SVM. Despite this, the AdaBoost model still have a fairly good accuracy of 73.26%, which is 1% better than the SVM model at 72.01%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With the priority of increasing recall, we recommend using an SVM with hyperparameter tuning and data balancing. This model provided the best recall performance relative to tree-based models and correctly identifyied over 70% of actual subscribers. However, this came at the cost of low precision and many false positives. If the bank is okay with this tradeoff, then this model can be used in production. However, if the bank wants to improve precision, then further hyperparameter tuning and data balancing techniques should be explored.\n",
